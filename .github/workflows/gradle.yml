name: Java CI with Gradle

# Trigger the workflow manually from the GitHub Actions UI
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    # The job will run on the latest Ubuntu virtual machine
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Set permissions for the job
    permissions:
      contents: read # Grants read-only access to repository contents

    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out the repository code
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # This action fetches the repository's code so it can be used in the workflow

    # Step 2: Set up JDK 21
    - name: Set up JDK 21
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '21' # Specifies the Java version to use
        distribution: 'temurin' # Specifies the JDK distribution (Temurin is the default OpenJDK)

    # Step 3: Set up Gradle
    - name: Setup Gradle
      uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@af1da67850ed9a4cedd57bfd976089dd991e2582 # v4.0.0
      # This action configures Gradle for use in the workflow and caches dependencies for faster builds

    # Step 4: Run the Gradle shadowJar task
    - name: Build Fat JAR with ShadowJar
      run: ./gradlew shadowJar
      # This command runs the Gradle shadowJar task to create a fat JAR (a single JAR containing all dependencies)

    # Step 5: Verify the output
    - name: Verify Fat JAR
      run: ls -lh build/libs
      # This command lists the contents of the build/libs directory to confirm the fat JAR was created successfully
    
    - name: Upload Shadow JAR
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: permissioning-plugin-shadow-jar
        path: build/libs/*.jar
